In this task, sales account data was provided to apply various conditional formatting techniques. The following explorations were performed:

- Highlight Formula Errors: Cells with formula errors were highlighted in purple with white text.

- Highlight Missing Values: Cells with missing values were highlighted in yellow.
- Cross-Sell Identification: Accounts that were not cross-sold with Product 2 were identified by highlighting the respective Product 2 cells in orange.
- Sales CAGR Analysis:
  - Cells with a 5-year CAGR of at least 100% were highlighted in green.
  - Cells with a negative CAGR were highlighted in red with white text.
-Top 10% Unit Sales (2021): Cells in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 were highlighted in blue.

**Task 3: VBA Macros**
Two macros were created to facilitate quick analysis of account sales data:

- Sort by 5-Year CAGR: This macro sorts the entire spreadsheet by the 5-year CAGR in descending order, helping identify accounts with the highest sales growth over the past five years.
- Sort by 2021 Unit Sales: This macro sorts the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order, highlighting the top-performing accounts based on unit sales.

Both macros are linked to buttons that allow users to switch between these two sorting methods quickly.

- Year-over-year sales growth
- Unit sales by account type
- Other actionable insights
  
This task emphasizes the importance of using visual storytelling to convey data-driven findings effectively.

Conclusion
